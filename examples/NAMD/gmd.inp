# Group definitions: group1 and group2 can be VMD-style selections
# if the program is running from the gmd.sh script (and VMD is available)
solute protein
solvent resname TMAO

# Otherwise, use a pdb file with beta factors (1.00 for group1 and 2.00 for group2)
# and "1.00" in the occupancy factor for the excluded selection.

# dbulk: The distance from the solute from which it is believed that
# the solution behaves as a bulk solution (the distance above which
# the influence of the solute on the solvent structure is negligible).
dbulk 10.

# cutoff: The maximum distance that must be considered for calculations.
# The greater the better but, of course, not too great so that periodic
# boundary conditions come into play. Also, calculations become slower
# with the square of the cutoff. An option is not to use a cutoff, in 
# which case the number of molecules in bulk will be simply the total
# number of molecules minus the number of molecules within dbulk. This 
# is the default option, which is set by not setting any cutoff.
#cutoff 15.

# binstep: The width of the histogram. It will not affect results, but
# it may affect the smoothness of the plots. Greater bins, greater smoothness,
# but the details are lost.
binstep 0.2

# nint: An integer parameter controling the precision of the numerical volume
# integration. The greater nint, the greater the precision (but at a cost
# proportional to nint).  
nint 10

# Use this option if you are running the package and printing the output
# on the screen:
#onscreenprogress

# Use this option if you want to change the reference atom of the solute used for
# monte-carlo volume integration (usually this option is irrelevant)
#irefatom 1
