# [Results](@id results)

```@meta
CollapsedDocStrings = true
```

The results of a MDDF calculation are returned in a data structure which contains 
the MDDF, KB integrals, and atomic contributions. The following section
will assume that the computation was performed by calling the `mddf`
function with 
```julia
results = mddf(trajectory_file, solute, solvent, Options(bulk_range=(8.0, 12.0)))
``` 
such that the `results` variable contain the `Result` data structure. By
default, the histograms contain 500 bins (`binstep=0.002` and
`cutoff=10.`) such that all data-vectors will contain 500 lines.

To learn how to save and load saved data, read the [next](@ref save) section.

## The Result data structure: main data

The most important data to be read from `results` are the distances,
minimum-distance distribution function, and KB integrals. These data is
stored in the following vectors:

## Distances of the histograms: `results.d`
The following vector will contain values ranging from 0. to `cutoff`,
and the distance at each bin is the distance in that bin for which half
of the volume of the bin is within `d`, and half of the volume is above
`d`, if the volume was spherical: 
```julia-repl
julia> results.d
500-element Array{Float64,1}:
 0.015874010519682
 0.033019272488946275
 ⋮
 9.970010030080179
 9.99001000999998
```

## Minimum-distance distribution function: `results.mddf`

The `results.mddf` vector will contain the main result, which the
minimum-distance distribution function. For a properly-sampled
simulation, it will be zero at very short distances and converge to 1.0
for distances smaller than the `cutoff`:
```julia-repl
julia> results.mddf
500-element Array{Float64,1}:
 0.0
 0.0
     ⋮
 0.999052514965403
 1.001030818286187

```

A typical plot of `results.mddf` as a function of `results.d` will look
like:

```@raw html
<img src="../figures/mddf.png" width="60%">
```

Thus, this plot was obtained with the following code:
```julia
using Plots
plot(results.d,results.mddf,xlabel="d/A",ylabel="mddf(d) / L/mol") 
```

## Kirkwood-Buff integral: `results.kb`

The `results.kb` vector will contain the Kirkwood-Buff integral computed
as a function of the minimum-distance to the solute. For properly
sampled simulations, it is expected to converge at large distances.  
```julia-repl
julia> results.kb
500-element Array{Float64,1}:
     0.0
    -0.3249356504752985
    -2.9804719721525
     ⋮
    0.72186381783
    1.13624162115
```

A typical plot of `results.kb` as a function of `results.d` will look
like:
```@raw html
<img src="../figures/kb.png" width="60%">
```

Thus, this plot was obtained with the following code:
```julia
using Plots
plot(
    results.d, 
    results.kb / 1000, # convert to L / mol
    xlabel="d/A",
    ylabel="mddf(d) / L/mol"
) 
```

## Units

* The distance is assumed to be in Å, as this is the most common
  distance units in molecular simulations. The coordinates of the atoms
  are assumed be provided in Å. 

* The minimum-distance distribution function is unit-less, since it is the
  ratio of the density at each distance divided by an ideal-gas density.

* The Kirkwood-Buff integrals are returned in cm³ mol⁻¹, if the
  coordinates were provided in Å.

!!! warning
    If the coordinates are not in Å, the calculation will 
    proceed normally, but the units of the KB integrals, which has units
    of volume per mol, should be
    converted to conform the length unit provided. Note that all coordinates
    that are supported by default (and are thus read by the Chemfiles library) will be 
    in Å, independently on the software used to generate the
    trajectories, as described [here](http://chemfiles.org/chemfiles/latest/overview.html#units). 

## Coordination number and other data

Obtaining the MDDF involves the computation of some intermediate properties that are frequently useful for additional solution structure analysis. In particular, the coordination numbers are computed. For example, the coordination number as a function from the distance to the solute can be retrieved from a `Results` data structure with:
```julia
coordination_number = results.coordination_number
```
and this data can be plotted against the distances by:
```julia
plot(result.d,results.coordination_number)
```

The coordination number of subgroups can also be obtained, as explained in the [Coordination number](@ref coordination_number) section.

The complete data available is:

| `d` | Vector of distances of the histograms.  | `Vector{Float64}` | To be used as the `x` coordinate on plotting any of the data. | 
| `md_count` | Non-normalized count of minimum distances at each `d`.  | `Vector{Float64}` | This is the number of minimum distances found at each histogram bin, without normalization. Usually this is not interesting to analyze, because it is dependent on the bin size. | 
| `md_count_random` | Number of minimum distances found at each histogram bin for the random distribution. | `Vector{Float64}` | This is the normalization required to convert the `md_count` array into the minimum-distance distribution. | 
| `coordination_number` | Cumulative number of sites found for each histogram distance. | `Vector{Float64}` | **This is the coordination number**, that is, the number of sites found cumulative up to each distance, without any normalization. | 
| `coordination_number_random` | Cumulative site count for the random distribution. | `Vector{Float64}` | Usually not interesting for analysis. | 
| `mddf` | The final distribution function. | `Vector{Float64}` | This is the MDDF computed (`md_count` normalized by `md_count_random`). It is the main result of the calculation. | 
| `kb` | The final Kirkwood-Buff integral. | `Vector{Float64}` | This is the final KB integral, as a function of the integration distance from the solute. Computed as `coordination_number - coordination_number_random` |

| `density.solvent_bulk` | Density (concentration) of the solute in the bulk region. | `Float64` | In units of molecules/$\textrm{\AA}^3$ |  
| `volume` | Volume measures. | `Volume` | Contains the total volume of the simulation, the bulk volume, the volume of the solute domain and the shell volume of each `bin` of the histogram. These are computed by numerical integration from the random distributions.  |   
| `files` | List of files read. | `Vector{String}` | | 
| `weights` | Weights of each file in the final counts. | `Vector{Float64}` | If the trajectories have different lengths or number of frames, the weights are adapted accordingly. |
